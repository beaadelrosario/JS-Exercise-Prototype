  EXAMPLE TASK:
    - Write an Airplane constructor that initializes `name` from an argument.
    - All airplanes built with Airplane should initialize with an `isFlying` of false.
    - Give airplanes the ability to `.takeOff()` and `.land()`:
        + If a plane takes off, its `isFlying` property is set to true.
        + If a plane lands, its `isFlying` property is set to false.

Airplane.prototype.takeOff = function () {
  this.isFlying = true;

  TASK 1
    - Write a Person Constructor that initializes `name` and `age` from arguments.
    - All instances of Person should initialize with an empty `stomach` array.
    - Give instances of Person the ability to `.eat("someFood")`:
        + When eating an edible, it should be pushed into the `stomach`.
        + The `eat` method should have no effect if there are 10 items in the `stomach`.
    - Give instances of Person the ability to `.poop()`:
        + When an instance poops, its `stomach` should empty.
    - Give instances of Person a method `.toString()`:
        + It should return a string with `name` and `age`. Example: "Mary, 50"

  TASK 4

  In your own words explain the four principles for the "this" keyword below:
  1. Global/Window Binding - when in the global scope, the value of THIS will be the window or console object
  2. Implicit Binding - implied that if you're using a method on an object that the context that you want is bound to what is left of the dot. Whenever a function is called by a preceding dot, the object left of the dot gets THIS
  3. New Binding - has to do with constructor functions - whenever a constructor function is used, THIS refers to the specific instance of the object that is created and returned by the constructor function
  4. Explicit Binding - [.bind .call .apply] binding objects together - whenever JavaScripts .call or .apply method is used, THIS  is explicitly defined
